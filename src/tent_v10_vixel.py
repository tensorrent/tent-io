TENT v10 — VIXEL FIELD GRID
============================

Architecture:
    LLM reads query → selects drop column (field)
    Token falls into field grid
    Vixels (specialist nodes) catch it
    RC14 escalation tiers fire
    Deterministic output with stakes and clinical grounding

Key distinctions:
    Voxel: knows position in space
    Vixel: knows position AND field (specialist node)
           carries clinical criteria, not just keywords
           grounded in DSM-5, ICD-10, clinical literature

The LLM does ONE thing: semantic field selection.
    Stochastic inference → deterministic entry point.
    "Chest pain" → drop into [cardiac] column.
    "I feel hopeless" → drop into [psychiatric] column.
    The LLM doesn't route. It aims.

DSM-5 criteria ARE conjunction gates.
    MDE: 5+ symptoms, ≥2 weeks, nearly every day.
    That is RC14 conjunction logic with count threshold.
    The criteria documents are the vixel definitions.

Knowledge sources:
    DSM-5:  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition
    ICD-10: International Classification of Diseases
    WebMD:  Symptom escalation pathways (clinical triage)
